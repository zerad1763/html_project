    <h1><strong>where are you?</strong></h1>
    <p>
      You were the shadow to my light Did you feel us Another start You fade
      away
    </p>

    <p>Afraid our aim is out of sight Wanna see us Alive</p>

    <p>Where are you now Where are you now</p>

    <p>
      Where are you now Was it all in my fantasy Where are you now Were you only
      imaginary
    </p>

    <p>Where Where are you now Atlantis Under the sea Under the sea</p>

    <p>
      Where Where are you now Another dream The monster’s running wild inside of
      me I’m faded
    </p>

    <p>Where I’m faded So lost, I’m faded I’m faded So lost, I’m faded</p>
