    <H1><strong>TAKE me home</strong> </H1>
    <P>Almost heaven West Virginia
        Blue Ridge Mountains Shenandoah River
        Life is old there older than the trees
        Younger than the mountains growing like breeze</p>
        
     <P>Country road take me home
        To the place I belong
        West Virginia mountain mama
        Take me home country road</P>
        
     <p>All my memories gather round her
        Miner's lady stranger to blue water
        Dark and dusty painted on the sky
        Misty taste of moon shine
        Teardrop in my eye</p>
        
     <p>I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me
        The radio reminds me of my home far away
        And driving down the road I get a feeling
        That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday</p>
        
     <p>Take me home country roads
        Take me home country roads</p>
        </P1>s
