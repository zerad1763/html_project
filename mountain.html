    <h1><strong>TAKE me home</strong></h1>
    <p>
      Almost heaven West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains Shenandoah River Life is
      old there older than the trees Younger than the mountains growing like
      breeze
    </p>

    <p>
      Country road take me home To the place I belong West Virginia mountain
      mama Take me home country road
    </p>

    <p>
      All my memories gather round her Miner's lady stranger to blue water Dark
      and dusty painted on the sky Misty taste of moon shine Teardrop in my eye
    </p>

    <p>
      I hear her voice in the morning hours she calls me The radio reminds me of
      my home far away And driving down the road I get a feeling That I should
      have been home yesterday, yesterday
    </p>

    <p>Take me home country roads Take me home country roads</p>
